# Annual-Sales-Analysis-and-Recommendation

The increasing volume of transactional data in retail and e-commerce sectors necessitates effective analysis techniques to derive actionable insights. This project focuses on analyzing sales transactions spanning multiple years to uncover trends, patterns, and key performance indicators. Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the study merges and cleanses datasets related to customers, products, shipping destinations, and transaction details. The primary objectives include understanding yearly sales trends, sales distribution by product category and market, the impact of discounts on profit margins, and regional sales variations. Additionally, the project aims to identify top-performing and underperforming products based on sales volume and profit. The findings from this analysis can assist businesses in optimizing their product offerings, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts to enhance profitability and customer satisfaction.
